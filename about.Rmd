### `r make_icon("fab fa-r-project")` Programming
I use `r make_icon("fab fa-r-project")` for my quantitative research projects. `r make_icon("fab fa-r-project")` has a good feature in cleaning and crafting a data visualization. I leverage `tidyverse` library for exploratory data analysis. This library includes `ggplot2` which is beneficial to craft a data viz that can be shared and reproduced with peers using **R Markdown**. 

In addition to R Markdown, I leverage this to create a portfolio website. To convert R Markdown to website, I utilize [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) library and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to reformat the Markdown into web. I also see the other guide for website thanks to [John Paul](https://www.jhelvy.com/about.html).

### College Life

I began studying Physics at ITERA as an undergraduate in the mid of 2017. I work as an assistant in practicum and lessons in Fundamental of Physics class for 2.5 years. This provides an opportunity to increase my communication & presenting skills in front of at least 40 college student. 

During the thesis, I choose to work on Computational Physics. It was developing Magneto-resistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) using C++ programming languages with [OOMMF](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/). Then, this project is presented on 11th ICTAP Physical Society of Indonesia in front of others Physicians.

### Mountaineering

I love to do a hike to exercise my body with my friends. I also love this because we have to carefully organize the transportation to get there and what food, cloth, & other to bring. This activity helps me to be grateful for everything.

### Books as a hobby

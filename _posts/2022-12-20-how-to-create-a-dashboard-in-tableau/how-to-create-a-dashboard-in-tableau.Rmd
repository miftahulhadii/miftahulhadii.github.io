## Introduction

In this activity, I want to design a dashboard about **World CO₂ Emissions Growth**. This dashboard will review about the average CO₂ per capita. Then, we try to investigate the production growth over the year in every region. Hopefully, this dashboard will be beneficial to reduces and mitigates the effects of global climate changes [1](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/economic-co-benefits-of-reducing-co2-emissions-outweigh-the-cost-of-mitigation-for-most-big-emitters/).

![**Fig. 1.** The spreading of factory residue](https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2019-09/processed/agw_topics_1024.jpg)

Here, we used the data sets from [The World Bank Group](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC), a world organization that work to reduce poverty in a country. This data sets include several variable such as:

-   Country Name
-   Year of CO₂ collected
-   CO₂ per Capita.


### What to analyze?

This data set can be used to find a questions that might arise such as:

-   Which country/region has the most average CO₂ per capita?
-   What region has the highest growth of CO₂ emitters?

Hopefully, this questions will be a step to reveal what inside the data sets and helps other countries to mitigate the global climate changes.

## Preparation

Here, I want to describe a few tools used in this analysis:

-   [Tableau Desktop](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover)
-   Excel (*for storing data*)
-   CO₂ Dataset [link](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)


## Create a Dashboard
Here's a step-by-step to create a clear dashboard about CO₂ growth.

### Load the Dataset

To connect the dataset to Tableau, the step as follows:

* First, open Tableau Public application.
* Then, the first window you see might be like this.

```{r connect dataset, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/connect-dataset-tableau.png")  
```
* Select **Microsoft Excel** (*because our dataset is in excel format*), then locate to the dataset file.
* Next, a lot of sheet inside of dataset will appear. This is Data Source window. 

```{r connect graphics 1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/connect-sheet.png")  
```
* Connect the Tableau to useful sheet that already been cleaned. Here, we choose `CO2 Data Cleaned` because the sheet involves metrics needed.
* Last, we can go to worksheet

```{r connect graphics 2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/go-to-worksheet.png")  
```

As a preview, here is a view of Tableau project we work on.

```{r connect graphics 3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/tableau-project-preview.png")  
```

As the image above, there are three sections that show up, including:

* **Left-side**  = Where the data stored.
* **Middle**     = Tools to refine your data visualization.
* **Right-side** = Place to view your visualization.

### Create a Graph
In this section, we want plotting the dataset about CO₂ activity in the World to answers question. 

#### Average CO₂ per Capita
Here's the step to create a clear graph of average CO₂ for every country:

* First, we put the `Country Name` column to **Detail** in Marks pane.

```{r average CO₂ 1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/1-a-country-name.png")  
```

* A map will appear with the country as a data points.

```{r average CO₂ 2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/1-b-country-appear.png")  
```

* Then, we calculate the average CO₂ for every country by put the `CO2 (kt)` column to **Size** in Marks pane.

```{r average CO₂ 3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/1-c-avg-co2.png")  
```


* Average of CO₂ will appear with circle size. The larger the circle, the highest average.

```{r average CO₂ 4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align= 'center'}
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics("~/GitHub/miftahulhadii.github.io/images/how-to-create-dashboard-tableau/1-d-country-size.png")  
```




#### Average CO₂ Growth in Every Country
Here's the step to a viz about CO₂ growth over the years:
* First,

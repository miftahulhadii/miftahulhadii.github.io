This report will analyze review about the device in Indian market. After that, we try to investigate the material used in the device including strap material, battery, and the price itself.\r\nFig. 1. Fitness Tracker DeviceHere, we used the data sets from Flipkart, one of an e-commerce website. This data sets include several variable such as:\r\nSelling Price\r\nSpecifications\r\nRatings\r\nReview from the Indian Market\r\nThis data has been collected using Kaggle in this link\r\nWhat to analyze?\r\nThis data set can be used to find a questions that might arise such as:\r\nWhat is the best strap material for Fitness Tracker Device?\r\nIs more battery life necessary for Smartwatches or Fitness Band?\r\nWhat is the mean price for selling a fitness tracker that might get at least 4.0 ratings?\r\nHopefully, this questions will reveal what inside the data sets and help other company to strategies the India Market.\r\nPreparation\r\nHere, I want to describe a few tools in this analysis:\r\nRStudio link\r\nLibrary including:\r\ntidyverse\r\nggplot2\r\ndplyr\r\nreadr\r\nskimr\r\n\r\nDataset link\r\nBefore doing our analysis, we loaded the library.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(skimr)\r\nlibrary(formattable)\r\nlibrary(ggpubr)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, load and name the dataset as a fitness_tracker using readr library.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nfitness_trackers <- read_csv(\"D:/Bahan Belajar/Experience/Sertifikasi LinkedIn/Project/1_R_Fitness Tracker_ecommerce/Fitness_trackers.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe best strap material for Fitness Tracker Device?\r\nFitness Band Material\r\nHere, we try to find which strap material for Fitness Band is having a high average rating. The rating is obtained by calculating the average rating per strap material. Then do the ranking analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmean_strap_fitnessband <- fitness_trackers %>% \r\n  group_by(`Strap Material`) %>%\r\n  filter (`Device Type` == \"FitnessBand\") %>% \r\n  summarize(avg_rating = mean(`Rating (Out of 5)`))\r\nggplot(data = mean_strap_fitnessband, \r\n       mapping = aes(x = avg_rating, y = reorder(`Strap Material`, avg_rating), alpha = avg_rating)) + \r\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"black\") + \r\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_rating, digits = 2), fontface = \"bold\"), nudge_x = +0.2, colour = \"black\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Rating for Fitness Band Material\", subtitle = \"based on Review in Indian Market\", x = \"Average Rating\", y = \"Strap Material\", alpha = \"Range of Rating\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the bar chart above, we see the brand name on the left-axis with their average rating. Elastomer is getting highest rating in Indian market by 4.22. Then follow tightly by Plastic. The use of leather is less preferable for Fitness Band in Indian market.\r\nSmartwatch Material\r\nHere, we try to find which strap material for Smartwatch is having a high average rating. The rating is obtained by calculating the average rating per strap material. Then do the ranking analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmean_strap_smartwatch <- fitness_trackers %>% \r\n  drop_na() %>% \r\n  group_by(`Strap Material`) %>%\r\n  filter (`Device Type` == \"Smartwatch\") %>% \r\n  summarize(avg_rating = mean(`Rating (Out of 5)`))\r\nggplot(data = mean_strap_smartwatch, \r\n       mapping = aes(x = avg_rating, y = reorder(`Strap Material`, avg_rating), alpha = avg_rating)) + \r\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"black\") + \r\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_rating, digits = 2), fontface = \"bold\"), nudge_x = +0.2, colour = \"black\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Rating for Smartwatch Material\", subtitle = \"based on Review in Indian Market\", x = \"Average Rating\", y = \"Strap Material\", alpha = \"Range of Rating\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the bar chart above, we see that Nylon is getting highest rating in Indian market by 4.4. Then follow tightly by Silicone. The use of rubber is less preferable for smart watches in Indian market.\r\nIs more battery life necessary for Smartwatches or Fitness Band?\r\nHere, we want to inspect whether or not if more battery life is an important factor for having a high rating in Indian Market. To do that:\r\nTake the Battery Life and Rating Column.\r\nThen, show the relationship between them using scatter plot.\r\nHere’s the formula in R\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nggplot(data = fitness_trackers, \r\n       mapping = aes(x = `Average Battery Life (in days)`, y = `Rating (Out of 5)`, alpha = `Rating (Out of 5)`)) + \r\n  geom_smooth() +\r\n  stat_cor(method = \"pearson\", label.x = -5, label.y = 4.8) +\r\n  facet_wrap(~`Device Type`) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Relationship between Battery Life vs. Rating\", subtitle = \"based on Review in Indian Market\", \r\n       x = \"Average Battery Life (in days)\", y = \"Rating\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the scatter plot above, we see the average battery life (in days) on the x-axis with their rating on y-axis. Scatter plot is used to reveal a correlation between two or more variables. Correlation coefficient is used to show whether strong or not the correlation is. If R is positive and near 1, then battery life is dependent to rating.\r\nIn Fitness Band on the left, we see that there is no strong linear correlation between battery life and rating. The R on Fitness band is 0.12. It shows that little correlation between them. Rating above 4.00 is actually obtained in battery life that has at least 5 to 20 days.\r\nIn Smartwatch on the right, we see that the R on Fitness band is -0.18. It shows a little negative linear correlation. Less battery life and is sometimes get a high rating. Higher rating with above 4.5 is obtained on battery life below 5 days.\r\nMean price for selling a fitness tracker\r\nHere, we want to inspect the mean price for selling a fitness tracker in Indian Market. We want the mean price will get at least 4.0 rating. To do that:\r\nTake the Selling Price and Rating Column.\r\nThen, show the relationship between them using scatter plot.\r\nLastly, check the mean selling price that will get at least 4.0 rating.\r\nHere’s the formula in R to check the correlation for selling price in Smartwatch.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmean_selling_smartwatch <- fitness_trackers %>% \r\n  group_by(`Rating (Out of 5)`) %>%\r\n  filter (`Device Type` == \"Smartwatch\") %>% \r\n  summarize(selling_price = mean(`Selling Price`))\r\nggplot(data = mean_selling_smartwatch, \r\n       mapping = aes(x = `Rating (Out of 5)`, y = selling_price)) + \r\n  geom_smooth() + \r\n  stat_cor(method = \"pearson\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Rating by Selling Price\", subtitle = \"on Smartwatch\", x = \"Device Rating\", y = \"Selling Price\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we see the chart above, the R value for Smartwatch’s selling price is low. So we unable to measure the mean selling price for getting higher rating, because little correlation between them.\r\nLet’s check the selling price in Fitness Band.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmean_selling_fitnessband <- fitness_trackers %>% \r\n  group_by(`Rating (Out of 5)`) %>%\r\n  filter (`Device Type` == \"FitnessBand\") %>% \r\n  summarize(selling_price = mean(`Selling Price`))\r\nggplot(data = mean_selling_fitnessband, \r\n       mapping = aes(x = `Rating (Out of 5)`, y = selling_price)) + \r\n  geom_smooth() + \r\n  stat_cor(method = \"pearson\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Rating by Selling Price\", subtitle = \"on Fitness Band\", x = \"Device Rating\", y = \"Selling Price\")+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4, y = 7000, label = \"The mean price to get more than 4.0 rating is ₹5,000\", fontface = \"bold\", angle = 25)+\r\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 4, y = 2500, xend = 4, yend = 4900, arrow = arrow(type = \"closed\", length = unit(0.02, \"npc\")))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we see the R, the correlation between selling price and rating on Fitness Band is strong (0.76 out of 1). So, we can measure the mean price to get more than 4.0 rating.\r\nNext, the mean price to get more than 4.0 rating is ₹5,000. If the selling price is increasing, the rating tend to be higher. Then the specifications price is needed to see further analysis on selling prices.\r\nConclusion\r\nAfter doing an analysis about fitness tracker in Indian market on 2022, we can conclude that:\r\nStrap material for different device require different material. Elastomer is preferable for Fitness Band. But for Smartwatches, the use of Nylon is getting highest rating.\r\nMore battery life on fitness tracker device is not necessary to get higher rating.\r\nThe preferable selling price for Fitness Band is ₹ 5,000. For Smartwatches, the selling price unable to be measured because no correlation with ratings.\r\nSuggestion\r\nFor further analysis, the specifications price is needed. This is important to measure a material with the lowest price but getting highest ratings.\r\nSource\r\nRStudio\r\nFitness Tracker Dataset: Kaggle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
